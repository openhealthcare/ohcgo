	<h1>Hack Days</h1>
	<h2>
		We can move fast.
	</h2>
	<h2>
		We believe that innovation happens when you give people freedom.
	</h2>
	<h2>
		Which is why we run Hack Days.
	</h2>
	<p>
		Hack Days are all about intensive collaboration. They allow you to
		sidestep the bureaucracy that slows down innovation, and rapidly
		realise fresh ideas. When you bring together multidisciplinary
		domain experts and inspire them, amazing things happen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most Hack Days last just a couple days, but what you get from that
		time is extraordinary. The intense focus towards a common goal turns
		ideas into reality before more traditional methods would be done
		deciding whether it was a good idea.
	</p>
	<h2>
		We believe in building communities.
	</h2>
	<h2>
		Which is why we started NHSHackDay.
	</h2>
	<p>
		Weekend events that bring together
		doctors, nurses, developers, designers, and other "geeks who love the NHS"
		to create disruptive solutions to problems in the health space.
	</p>
	<h2>
		We believe that people have great ideas, and want to do great work.
	</h2>
	<h2>
		Which is why we organize hack days.
	</h2>
	<p>
		For people with great ideas, there is no better way to prove them, than
		getting a bunch of talented, motivated people in a room, and lighting a
		fire under them.
