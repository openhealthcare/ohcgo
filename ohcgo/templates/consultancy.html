	  We can help you to develop a sane technology strategy.

	  Public sector technology procurement is broken. It's an old story. But we
	  believe passionately that it doesn't have to be this way.

	  By combining a deep understanding of health and technology with a wide
	  support network of senior healthcare and technology leaders, we can help
	  to make it better.
